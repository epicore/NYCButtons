# README NYCButtons Demo â™£

**A Demo of NYCSpinnerButton and NYCStickyButton in a sample Xcode Project**

I made some custom buttons for a recent bike map project.
They have a nice UX, a nice animation, and a good look and feel when used inside of the UIView nav holder I made. 
So here it is all bundled up in an Xcode project.

## Installation

Download the Repo, open the project file in Xcode. 

## Usage

The image files can be swapped out. 
Change state colors as you require. 
The navigation holder (UIView) uses autolayout for a resizable and equally spaced button tab bar. 
But the  NYCSpinnerButton and NYCStickyButton can be used independent of this implementation. 

## Requirements

The project was created in Xcode 7.3.1
And the code-base is created to work with iOS 8.0 - iOS 9.3 (the current version).
